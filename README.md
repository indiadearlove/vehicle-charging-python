# Vehicle Charging

### Technologies used

- Python
- Django Framework
- SQLite DB (postgres would probably be more appropriate in the long run)
- React

### Assumptions made

- Individual companies would want thier own styling
- Users would use mobile or a small device
- Battery charging is linear


### Spend time on

- architecture thinking of what data we would want to capture and what the user needs to see
- backend working on creating the APIs

### Less time on

- spent time setting up the frontend but little time styling, the little styling I did was inline which usually I would never do
- frontend files are pretty much all auto generated, would like to spend time sorting and creating individual components rather than all in one disorganised file
- Connecting up the schedule to auto create charges
- No time on tests!

### how you designed the system bearing in mind its end use
